          <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
            Due to Covid-19 Pandemic, the country was under a complete lockdown
            since 22nd March, 2020 . Though the lockdown has been partially
            eased at some zones, the travel restrictions, social stancing and
            other protective measures are likely to stay for a long time. These
            measures are necessary in order to curb the spread of Corona virus
            infection. However, it has created hurdles for prospective parents
            to visit the school for consultation of their queries related to
            admission, such as procedure, Fees, Hostel, etc. Therefore, to
            address the queries of prospective parents / students, the Admission
            Team is facilitating two modes of communication as given below:
          </p>

          </p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: "14px", fontSize: "14px" }}>
            <b>Through Online Meeting :</b> Online one to one interactive
            meeting will be scheduled for prospective parents / students with
